# ACNL_REditor

This tool is a WIP Rom Editor For Animal Crossing: New Leaf.
* It supports *only* the latest ACNL update, and works with all ACNL games **except** Korean (at the time of writing).
* Currently, only the checkbox patches in Exefs -> General tab actually work. Everything else isn't applied yet, but it will be implemented very soon.


ACNL_REditor is inspired by the amazing [pk3DS](https://github.com/kwsch/pk3DS) project by [kwsch](https://github.com/kwsch).

Requires [QT](https://www.qt.io/) for compilation. (Only QT 5.11.1 has been tested, milage may vary with other versions).
